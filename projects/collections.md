# Future Job

Read over the code to understand what it does.

When you're comfortable with it, complete the following steps.

1. Add at least two jobs to the array.
1. Output the last job instead of the first.
1. Use the `index` variable instead of the literal.
1. Output the last job using `.length` ([helpful link](https://javascript.info/array)).
1. Add a random number generator so that you get a different job every time you click ([helpful link](https://www.google.com/search?q=javascript+how+to+get+random+index+from+array)).

# Subject List

Read over the code to understand what it does.

When you're comfortable with it, complete the following steps.

1. Add two more subjects to the array in the code.
1. Change the `addSubject` function so that it adds 'Science' instead of 'Maths' to the array.
1. Change the `addSubject` function so that it asks the user for a subject to add to the array, instead of adding one that you coded.
1. Change the `removeSubject` function so that it removes the last subject instead of the first.
1. Change the `removeSubject` function so that it asks the user for the index of the subject to remove, instead of removing the one you coded.
1. Check that your `removeSubject` function now removes any subject you want. What happens when you put in a number that isn't an expected index?
1. Add input validation to the `removeSubject` function so that users can only enter numbers that are valid indexes.
* *Hint: use `.length`.*

## Future Job

Read over the code to understand what it does.

When you're comfortable with it, complete the following steps.

1. Add at least two jobs to the array.
1. Output the last job instead of the first.
1. Use the `index` variable instead of the literal.
1. Output the last job using `.length` ([helpful link](https://javascript.info/array)).
1. Add a random number generator so that you get a different job every time you click ([helpful link](https://www.google.com/search?q=javascript+how+to+get+random+index+from+array)).

## Subject List

Read over the code to understand what it does.

When you're comfortable with it, complete the following steps.

1. Add two more subjects to the array in the code.
1. Change the `addSubject` function so that it adds 'Science' instead of 'Maths' to the array.
1. Change the `addSubject` function so that it asks the user for a subject to add to the array, instead of adding one that you coded.
1. Change the `removeSubject` function so that it removes the last subject instead of the first.
1. Change the `removeSubject` function so that it asks the user for the index of the subject to remove, instead of removing the one you coded.
1. Check that your `removeSubject` function now removes any subject you want. What happens when you put in a number that isn't an expected index?
1. Add input validation to the `removeSubject` function so that users can only enter numbers that are valid indexes.
* *Hint: use `.length`.*

## Number Search

Read over the code to understand what it does ([helpful link](https://javascript.info/array-methods#iterate-foreach)).

When you're comfortable with it, complete the following steps.

1. Change `searchTarget` to 2 and run the code to see if it's in the array.
1. Change the `numberSearch` function so that it asks the user what number to search for.
1. Test your code to check that it works on numbers that are in the array and ones that aren't,
1. Add a button to `index.html` and write an `showNumbers` function so that the user can see the numbers.
1. Add a button to `index.html` and write an `addNumber` function so that the user can add numbers to the array.
1. Add input validation so that users can *only* add numbers to the array.
1. Add a button to `index.html` and write a `removeNumber` function so that the user can remove numbers from the array using the index of the number.
1. **(Extra)** Modify your `removeNumber` function so that it searches for and removes specific numbers, rather than using the index.

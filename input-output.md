## Māori Mihi (pair)

Mihi (greeting) is an extremely important part of Māori culture. Before speaking in a formal setting (such as a marae) it is expected that you annonuce who you are and where you come from with a mihi. Through a mihi, others can make connections with your pepeha (iwi affiliations to particular natural landmarks) and your whakapapa/genealogy. A mihi has strong spiritual significance as you are speaking on behalf of your tīpuna (ancestors) as well as bringing them along for your kōrero.

Write a program to help the user create a mihi with the following structure:

> Tēnā koutou katoa,

> Ko [mountain] tōku maunga,

> Ko [river/ocean/lake/bay-harbour] tōku awa/moana/roto/whanga,

> Ko [vessel] tōku waka,

> Ko [people] tōku iwi,

> Nō [home town] au,

> Ko [name] tōku ingoa,



> Tēnā koutou,

> Tēnā koutou,

> Tēnā koutou, katoa.

## Non-Māori Mihi (pair)

If you start with a line like 'Ko Aoraki te maunga', by naming a Māori mountain some people will assume you are Māori. It is up to you to decide what structure to use, but this guide uses an alternative approach for non-Māori given by a mamber of Ngāi Tahu that acknowledges ancestral landmarks without any potential confusion.

Write a program to help the user create a mihi with the following structure:

> Tēnā koutou,

> Kei te mihi au ki a [mountain],

> Kei te mihi au ki a [river/ocean/lake/bay-harbour],

> Ko Te Tiriti o Waitangi te waka,

> Ko Aotearoa te iwi,

> Nō [home town] au,

> Ko [name] tōku ingoa,

> Tēnā koutou,

> Tēnā koutou,

> Tēnā koutou, katoa.

## The Repeater (individual)

Write a program that takes the user's input and then repeats it back to them immediately.

For example:

> Say something: hello

> You said: hello
